**Mike N:** @frank I like the idea of a framework rather than a quilt
of libraries you have to stitch together. Both are great choices
imo.

Lukas's summary of Angular 2

* Everything is a Class. You have an ES6 class, some metadata, and
  everything is a variation on that.

* Understand how ES6 class works.
* Understand how to wrap it in metadata.
* Understand binding, then you have a component.

From there, it's a matter of stacking them together to get what you
want. At the bottom of it all, is just a component.

"A component is an element. A directive is an attribute modifying a
component."
